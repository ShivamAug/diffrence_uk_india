20/07/2020 13:27:34,Wet Draw2,Jayaprakash Achuthan,Sir the input bobbin seams to be possible cause.We are trying that bobbin in another machine at today night.
20/07/2020 13:32:06,Wet Draw2,Thirumurugan Ramalingam,JP If Input coil is  the issue them why you changed the Machine ???
20/07/2020 13:54:43,Wet Draw2,Jayaprakash Achuthan,Setting to be made from pay-off which will delay to start the machine.So wd5 machine which is ready is started
